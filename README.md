This is just a fork of two projects, compiled into one 
for deployment convenience.
The first is https://github.com/dragorosson/hotbuilder_horizon
And the second is https://github.com/rackerlabs/hotbuilder

Also in this version I've commented out calls of '.chargeDistance()'
in topology.js beause the caused errors on my env. 
The modifications were made with 280 and 312 lines in topology.js.
